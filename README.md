## Goal

To create a Weather App with the following criteria:

- Use a CSS Framework other than Bootstrap
- Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
- Use at least two server-side APIs.
- Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
- Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
- Be responsive.
- Have a polished UI.
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming  
  conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
- Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Description:

An app organization platform that allows you to see all your favotire apps on a single page. The project has the following features.

1. A weather section that uses an API to track your location and tell you the weather and forecast.
2. A game section including a 3 third party games and one created game.
3. Youtube section:

   - delete all button
   - individual delete button for each saved item
4. News section
   - displays the hottest trending news topic entered in search bar
   - ability to save favorites
   - displays title, description, image, and source link
   - delete all button
   - individual delete button for each saved item
5. SideBar

## Technologies Used:

1. Bulma Framework
2. News Api
3. Youtube Data Api
4. Weather Api

## Successes

- Ethan: Was able to successfully implement two apis. Learned how to target items better.

## Challenges

- Ethan: I wish I refactored my code more often as I went. Some issues that should have been simple ended up taking a lot longer to solve
  because my code organization was messy. I'm going to spend more time pseudocoding in the future to keep things cleaner.
